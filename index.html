        <h2>ABOUT MODELS</h2>
        <p>Some of our plane models have their own story. Like A340 has its own story. First, A340 was invented. We wanted a motor from a good engine company. This model of the motor is already invented, but it wasn't built yet. As we wanted the delivery, the company told us that there are no parts anymore. We needed to make the wings longer and the plane needed to have 4 small engines.</p>
